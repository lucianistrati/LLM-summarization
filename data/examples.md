TITLE PARAGRAPH: Introduction
Since the first use of in vitro transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA) to express an exogenous protein in mice in 1990
Several features of in vitro transcribed mRNA contribute to its vaccine potential. First, the development process of an mRNA vaccine can be much faster than conventional protein vaccines
The mRNAs used as vaccines can be categorized into conventional mRNAs and self-amplifying mRNAs. Conventional mRNAs are similar to endogenous mRNAs in mammalian cells, consisting of a 5' cap, 5' UTR, coding region, 3' UTR, and a polyadenylated tail
Three major types of proteins are encoded by mRNA vaccines: antigens
Advances in recent years made mRNA a promising vaccine platform. For example, chemical modifications of RNA using nucleotide analogs, such as pseudouridine, dramatically increased protein production in vivo by diminishing the translation inhibition triggered by the unmodified nucleotides
In this chapter, we summarize the routes of administrations for mRNA vaccines, discuss mRNA delivery carriers and their corresponding formulation methods, and overview the challenges and future development of mRNA vaccines. A comprehensive overview of recent advances in mRNA vaccine delivery may facilitate the future development of novel delivery strategies and effective mRNA vaccines.

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Modifications of mRNA cap and tail
The 5 -cap and poly(A) tail are the hallmarks of eukaryotic mRNA. The native form of 5 -cap in cellular mRNA is featured with 7-methylguanosine (m 7 G) triphosphate group, which is formed in co-transcriptional process and is able to protect mRNA from 5 end degradation by cellular exonucleases
The cap mimics in synthetic mRNA were designed and made in order to enhance its translation efficiency and stability, as well as to reduce intracellular innate immunogenicity by impeding stimulation of RIG-I
Apart from the modifications in guanosine, chemical manipulations of phosphate bridge have also yielded improved properties. The substitution of oxygen with sulfur at the Î² position of the triphosphate bridge in m 7 GpppG results in high affinity of the cap to eIF4E and low susceptibility to the decapping complex DCP1/DCP2
The 3 -end of cellular mRNA in eukaryotes is decorated with poly(A) which plays a key role in regulating mRNA stability and translation efficiency

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Messenger RNA delivery vehicles
The rapid clinical translation of mRNA-based vaccines or therapies has benefited from the development of delivery vehicles to protect and deliver the highly unstable mRNA molecules. Currently, the major mRNA delivery systems are lipid-based nanoparticles, polymer-based nanoparticles and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles.
Lipid-based nanoparticles. Lipid-based nanoparticles are the most intensively studied and clinically advanced vehicles for mRNA delivery
The development of ionizable lipid-based nanoparticles for mRNA delivery has, to a great extent, benefited from studies over decades on ionizable lipid-based nanoparticles for the delivery of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which enable targeted silencing of endogenous mRNAs. For instance, DLin-MC3-DMA (MC3)
In addition to MC3, several other ionizable lipids initially developed for siRNA delivery, such as cKK-E12 (refs.
Lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles. Another type of nanoparticle is the lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle, which normally includes an ionizable (or sometimes cationic) lipid, a hydrophobic polymer and a PEGylated lipid

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Introduction
mRNA-messenger ribonucleic acid-is a single-strand copy of a selected part of the genetic sequence of a gene, negatively charged with secondary and tertiary structure formations. It is produced from DNA and-after appropriate modification-leads to the synthesis of a specific protein by a ribosome. It was first described in 1961

TITLE PARAGRAPH: Component
Nucleotides Function mRNA is composed of nucleotide building blocks consisting of a selection of four different nucleobases, adenine, cystine, guanine, and uracil, coupled to ribose which contains a phosphate group as the linker to the next nucleotide. mRNA transfers the genetic information for the synthesis of a specific protein from the genes via the DNA to the protein production facility: the ribosome. The nucleotides constitute the alphabet of the genetic code. Three consecutive nucleotides, for example, AUG, function as codons. Accordingly, by using four letters of the alphabet, A, C, G, and U, 64 different codons are possible. In general, codons define the amino acid which will be recruited next in the protein synthesis. On top of that, a single codon or groups of codons have specific functions, for example, the codon AUG codes for the amino acid methionine and operates as the start codon for the coding part of the mRNA. Table 
The task mRNA has to fulfil involves the following steps. It starts with the production of a single-strand copy of the genetic code laid down in the DNA, which is performed by RNA polymerase. This process is called transcription and leads to precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA), which-via splicing procedures-finally becomes mature mRNA. In parallel to transcription, the 5 cap is added to the molecule and the poly(A) tail is attached at the end of the chain. After that, the mRNA is transported from the nucleus of the cell to the cytosol. Various mechanisms can be utilized for this step involving different proteins, such as CBP20 and CBP80. Subsequently, ribosomes take over, read the code, and start the protein synthesis according to the codons provided in the coding section of the mRNA. The synthesis is terminated as soon as a stop codon is reached. Stop codons are UAG (amber), UAA (ochre), and UGA (opal). Thereafter, the mRNA is degraded by ribonucleases. mRNA activates the innate immune response through various RNA sensors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and protein kinase R (PKR)
